            <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

            <p>Enforcement of any dispute relating to these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict and choice of law principles. For parties residing in the United States, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Services or Service Content will lie in the state and federal courts located in City and County of San Francisco, California, and you irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

            <p>For parties residing outside the United States, any dispute arising hereunder shall be submitted to confidential binding arbitration in the County and City of San Francisco, California for the maximum judgment enforceable, except that to the extent Customer has in any manner violated or threatened to violate Onfleet‚Äôs intellectual property rights, Onfleet may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the State of California. Customer hereby consents to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of California. Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted pursuant to the existing International Arbitration Rules at the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim is initiated in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>

            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

            <p>The terms and conditions which by their nature are intended to survive termination of these Terms shall survive, including Restrictions, Disclaimer of Warranties, Feedback, Indemnity, and Limitation of Liability.</p>
